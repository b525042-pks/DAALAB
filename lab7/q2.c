// Question 2:
// [Super egg testing experiment] A firm has invented a super-strong egg. For publicity
// purposes, it wants to determine the highest floor in a 100-storey building from which such an
// egg can fall without breaking. The firm has given a tester two identical eggs to experiment
// with. Of course, the same egg can be dropped multiple times unless it breaks. What is the
// minimum number of droppings that is guaranteed to determine the highest safe floor in all
// cases? Design a dynamic programming generalized solution for E eggs and F floors.
