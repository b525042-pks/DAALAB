// Question 6:
// [The best time to be alive] An editor of The History of the World Science wants to find
// out the time when the largest number of prominent scientists were alive. The prominent
// scientists are, by definition, the people mentioned in the book with the dates of their birth
// and death. (No living scientists are included in the book.) Devise an algorithm for this task
// if it has the book’s index as its input. The entries in the index are sorted alphabetically
// and give the persons’ birth and death years. If a person A died the same year person B
// was born, assume that the former event happened before the latter one.

// Input representation: Array of 2n events
// Algorithm:
//     1. Create birth and death events.
//     2. Sort events by year.
//     3. For equal years, process death before birth.
//     4. Sweep through the sorted events.
//     5. Maintain the current number of living scientists.
//     6. Store the maximum count and corresponding year.
// Time Complexity  = O(n log n)
// Space Complexity = O(n)

// CODE---
