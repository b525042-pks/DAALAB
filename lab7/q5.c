// Question 5 :
//  [Hitting a moving target] A computer game has a shooter and a moving target. The
// shooter can hit any of n > 1 hiding spots located along a straight line in which the target
// can hide. The shooter can never see the target; all he knows is that the target moves to
// an adjacent hiding spot between every two consecutive shots. Design an algorithm that
// guarantees hitting the target or prove that no such algorithm exists.
// If any such algorithm exists, by choosing the proper input representation, write a program
// in C to validate your algorithm and derive the complexity analysis of your algorithm.

// ALGORITHM: HIT_MOVING_TARGET(n)
// INPUT:
//     n = number of hiding spots, where n > 1
// OUTPUT:
//     A sequence of shooting positions that guarantees hitting the target
// BEGIN
//     IF n = 2 THEN
//         Shoot at position 1
//         Shoot at position 1 again
//         RETURN
//     END IF
//     // Move from left to right.
//     // Shoot at every position from 2 to n-1.
//     FOR position = 2 TO n-1 DO
//         Shoot at position
//     END FOR
//     // Move back from right to left.
//     // Shoot at every position from n-1 to 2.
//     FOR position = n-1 DOWNTO 2 DO
//         Shoot at position
//     END FOR
// END
